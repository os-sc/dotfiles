# dotfiles
A place to keep track of my dotfiles.  

Setup scripts and some of the stuff stolen from [https://github.com/gelus](gelus)!  

### quick setup
```
# chomd +x setup.sh; ./setup.sh
```
This will create symbolic links between the dotfiles and their proper locations.  

Use `$ ./setup.sh clean` to remove all created links.
