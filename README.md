# Dotfiles
A place to keep track of my dotfiles.  

### Quick setup
```
# chomd +x setup.sh
$ ./setup.sh link
```

### Notes

- Use `$ ./setup.sh clean` to remove all created links (see `./setup.sh --help` for details).  
- The `.xinitrc` will *not* be installed by the setup script.  
- To install the plugins for vim, open vim and run `:PluginInstall`
