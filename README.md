# dotfiles
A place to keep track of my dotfiles.  

### quick setup
```
# chomd +x setup.sh; ./setup.sh
```
This will create symbolic links between the dotfiles and their proper locations.  

Use `$ ./setup.sh clean` to remove all created links.  

The `.xinitrc` will *not* be installed by the setup script.  
To install the plugins for vim type `:PluginInstall`
